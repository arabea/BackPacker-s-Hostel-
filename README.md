# BackPacker-s-Hostel-
A website of a hostel in Mauritius. It serves as a way to introduce the hostel services and a contact form for the bookings. HTML & CSS. University Project 2018.

# What I have enjoyed
1. I have enjoyed the design process. It's rewarding to be able to present something simple yet formative at the end

# What I need to work on:
1. I have been challenged by the design process. I have to find a better way to structure the way I design before I code. 
2. There is much into css that I need to dig deep in. The interactive elements in the index and cafe pages for instance.
